# City_Weather_Checker
The City_Weather_ Cheker is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. It leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, while integrating with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live data.
